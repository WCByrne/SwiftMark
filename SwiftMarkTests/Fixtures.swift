    This is a *complex* string the has _many_ variations in it.

    ## Header
    ### Header
    #### Header

    ### Styling
    This is *bold*
    This is _italic_
    This is `Code`
    This is ~strike~

    ### Blocks
    Now for the blocks like Code blocks:
    ```
    if (false) {
       // this will never happen
    }
    else {
       // everyone likes it when we end up here!
    }
    ```

    > Note: The code above doesn't do *anything* but this is a cool quote!

    ### Summary
    This is cool stuff
