# SwiftMark

![Development](https://github.com/WCByrne/SwiftMark/workflows/Development/badge.svg)

Work in progress Markdown parser in Swift.

## Goals
* Pure Swift
* Flexible use - ability to choose features
* Follow some standard of markdown (early approach is closer to GFM)
* Generate a generic AST for flexible rendering
* Performance (at some point)

## Docs
