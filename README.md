# SwiftMark 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WCByrne/SwiftMark.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WCByrne/SwiftMark)

Work in progress Markdown parser in Swift.

## Goals
* Pure Swift
* Flexible use - ability to choose features
* Follow some standard of markdown (early approach is closer to GFM)
* Generate a generic AST for flexible rendering
* Performance (at some point)
